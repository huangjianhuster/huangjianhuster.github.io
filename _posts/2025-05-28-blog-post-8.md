<p align="justify">Spending five year or so doing computational biophysics research in Prof. Jianhan Chen's lab, I have successfully completed my PhD dissertation defense and have officially become a PhD in computational biophysics.</p>

I want to express my deepest gratitude to Prof. Jianhan for his guidance and supervision during my PhD program. Thanks to him, I had many valuable opportunities to work in the field of computational biophysics, including molecular mechanism studies of ion channel functions, coarse-grained simulations for protein domain interactions as well as Al-driven ensemble generative modeling. I could not have done any of those without his tremendous and unconditional supports. I would like to also thank many other people, my dissertation committee members, all my lab members, my dear friends and family members for their supports in various aspects.

Finishing the PhD study was indeed a highly rewarding journey where I gained scientific skills, mental strength, and friendships.
